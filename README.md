# House-Price-Prediction

*Description:*  
This project applies machine learning regression techniques to predict real estate prices and analyze key factors influencing property value variation. The workflow includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and the implementation of predictive regression models. The project emphasizes interpretability and model validation, using cross-validation and performance metrics to ensure robust predictions. All analyses are conducted in Jupyter notebooks, demonstrating practical applications of AI and predictive modeling in real estate analytics.
